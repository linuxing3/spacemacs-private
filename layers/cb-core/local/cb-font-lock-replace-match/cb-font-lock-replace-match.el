(defun cb-font-lock-replace-match (regex group replacement)
  "Return a font-lock replacement spec for use with `font-lock-add-keywords'.

REGEX surrounds the text to be replaced with a group.

GROUP is the number of the group.

REPLACEMENT is the string to substitute for the match in REGEX."
  (list regex
        `(0 (progn (compose-region (match-beginning ,group) (match-end ,group)
                                   ,replacement 'decompose-region)
